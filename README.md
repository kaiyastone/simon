while doing the html and css assignments, I learned how they work together to create a nice visual expereience for the user. you can use bootstrap to have easy access to many premade visuals, and you can use flex to make your webpage adaptable for different devices.

while doing the JavaScript I learned how JS is used to capture data from the user and create an experience for the user that is more than just visual. With JS, they are able to interact with the webpage and feel like they are really part of it.
